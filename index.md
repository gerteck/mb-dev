## What just happened?

You have just stumbled upon the _best_ MarkBind generated diving site! It is equipped with a set of core features, including site and page navigation. Additionally, we have included some convenient links to MarkBind's User Guide, in case you want to build your own, and get started quickly and easily.

<box type="tip">

If you want to start with a <tooltip content="i.e. without any content">_minimal_</tooltip> template instead, use the `--template` flag with the "minimal" option to initialize a minimal site instead of the default. See <a href="https://markbind.org/userGuide/templates.html" target="_blank">User Guide: Templates</a> for more information.
